ExtName=(Experimental) IBM Notifications 
ExtDesc=IBM Notification Services provides basic phone, text and email notifications.  
ExtMessage=This job type is experimental and used to get feedback.  Please provide feedback using our <a href="https://hub.jazz.net/project/alchemy/Alchemy-Update"> DevOps Services Project</a> using the track and plan capabilities. You need to set 'NOTIFY_ID' as a Text Property and 'NOTIFY_PASSWORD' as a Secure Property in the environment variables for the phone, text or email notification. You need to set 'SLACK_WEBHOOK_PATH' as a Secure Property in the environment variables for stack notification. <br>By default this extension will always send notifications when it runs. For full information on how to change this, read the (i)nformation next to the 'Send notification' and 'Message details' fields.

PHONE_DESC=Phone number to call when job executes.   

TXT_KEY=Text Number

SLACK_CHANNEL_DESC=Slack channel to send notification to when job executes.

MESSAGE_KEY=Message Details
MESSAGE_DESC=Contents of the notification. Environment variables set on the stage can be used within this message and can be modified by a previous job within this stage, i.e.: Previous job provided message $NOTIFY_JOB_MESSAGE

ONLY_NOTIFY_KEY=Send notification:
ONLY_NOTIFY_DESC=Notifications can be sent using this Job extension when previous jobs in this stage were successful or failed.  The default behavior is for the notification to be sent when this job is run which typically occurs when previous jobs have been successful.  If you wish a notification to be sent when previous jobs failed, add an environment variable NOTIFY_JOB_STATUS to the stage, set the previous job such that 'Stop stage execution on job failure' is set to false and have the previous job script set NOTIFY_JOB_STATUS to 0 for success or 1 for failure.  If NOTIFY_JOB_STATUS is set, this job will exit with that value, allowing stage execution to be stopped by a previous failure.

ANY_KEY=Always
SUCCESS_KEY=Previous jobs were successful
FAILURE_KEY=Previous jobs failed
