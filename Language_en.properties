MESSAGE_KEY=Message Details
MESSAGE_DESC=Contents of the notification. If you wish the notification to include information from a previous job, add an environment variable NOTIFY_JOB_MESSAGE to the stage, have the previous job script export NOTIFY_JOB_MESSAGE with your message, and set this value to something that contains the message, i.e.: Previous job message was $NOTIFY_JOB_MESSAGE

ONLY_NOTIFY_KEY=Send Notification:
ONLY_NOTIFY_DESC=The default behavior is for the notification to be sent when this job is run, which occurs when previous jobs in this stage have been successful.  If you wish a notification to be sent when a previous job has failed, add an environment variable NOTIFY_JOB_STATUS to the stage, set the previous job such that 'Stop stage execution on job failure' is set to false, and have the previous job script export NOTIFY_JOB_STATUS as 0 for success or 1 for failure.  If NOTIFY_JOB_STATUS is set, this job will exit with that value, allowing stage execution to be stopped by a previous failure.

ANY_KEY=Always
SUCCESS_KEY=Previous jobs were successful
FAILURE_KEY=Previous jobs failed
